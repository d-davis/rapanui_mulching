Data & File Overview
--------------------

### File list:
-- Supplemental_Document.pdf - R-markdown file of machine learning script developed to identify lithic mulching features from WorldView-3 satellite imagery.

-- Supplemental_Code.R - R script contained in the Markdown file.

-- Mulch_Estimation.zip -- zip folder containing a raster dataset with cleaned lithic mulching estimations for Rapa Nui. Data was produced using a Maximum Entropy algorithm and was manually evaluated to remove errors.

-- Training_Data.zip -- zip folder containing shapefiles with training data used for machine learning classification of WorldView-3 satellite images.
